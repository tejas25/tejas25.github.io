      <description>Analysis of Food Inspection InspectionsThe Health Division of the Department of Inspectional Services ensures that all food establishments in the City of Boston meet relevant sanitary codes and standards. Businesses that serve food are inspected at least once a year, and follow-up inspections are performed on high risk establishments. Health inspections are also conducted in response to complaints of unsanitary conditions or illness. This is a legacy dataset containing records of individual inspections and results.</description>
